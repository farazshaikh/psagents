# Rules for attempting bug fixes introduced generated AI Code

## Use interactive approach ###
Look at the issue
Understand the root cause
Present approach to fixing before attempting a fix.

## Attempting a fix ###

Recursively reason how a fix would impact existing logic. For example if i remove this variable, which other part fo the code will be impacted.

Pay extereme focus on no regressing on existing functionality

## Don't fix by implementing new code path ##

The fix involves understanding and editing existing code. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REWRITE THE ENTIRE LOGIC AGAIN.

## If bug isn't clear Ask for logs ##

If the bug isn't clear ask additional logs, you can insert logs and request for logs for you to review.

## Most of the code is working and bugs are usually point fixes ##

Never go into a mode of unilaterally rewriting large parts of the code without user consent.
