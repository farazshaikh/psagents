# Cursor Rules

## Whenever you need a React component

1. Carefully consider the component's purpose, functionality, and design

2. Think slowly, step by step, and outline your reasoning


3. Check if a similar component and styles that already exists in any of the following locations
   1. gameshow/web/reactweb/src/components
   2. gameshow/web/reactweb/src/styles

4. If it doesn't exist, generate a detailed prompt for the component, including:
   - Component name and purpose
   - Desired props and their types
   - Any specific styling or behavior requirements
   - Mention of using CSS for styling
   - Request for TypeScript usage
   - Maintain styling consitency for color themes, fonts, font sizing - similar to the Instagram app and its it live feature.
   - Create components that can be built and test in isolation. Prioritize composability, reuse and simplicity.


5. After generating, adapt the component to fit our project structure:
   - Ensure it follows our existing component patterns
   - Add any necessary custom logic or state management

6. Comments start with // don't include them in rules.
-- Follwing are comments dont include them
//Example prompt template:
//"Create a React component named {ComponentName} using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It should {description of functionality}. Props 
//should include {list of props with types}. The component should {any specific styling or behavior notes}. Please provide the full .
//component code."
