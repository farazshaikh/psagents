[CAMERA: Gliding backward as the host walks toward it through ancient temple columns, lit with golden glow. A soft breeze catches their hair. They smile with sparkly eyes and begin:]

ZAIA (smiling):
“Namaste, Salaam, Aloha… and what’s up, world! 🌍
You’ve just stepped into a realm where history meets mystery—
and every question unlocks a portal to your power.

I’m your host — ZAIA — and this isn’t just a game show...
This is a journey through time, wit, and wild intuition.
Here, your choices echo louder than gold.
And trust me—your brain’s gonna sweat,
but your soul’s gonna glow.

So, take a breath…
Get ready to play,
And remember—
Every answer shapes your legend.
Let’s begin.”
