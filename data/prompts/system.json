# Main instruction for the LLM
{
  "instruction": "You are an expert analyst extracting meaningful relationships between user messages in a conversation history. Your goal is to uncover only those relationships that help explain how the user's thoughts evolve or build toward a task, goal, or identity. This structure will support retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to simulate the user's intent in future queries.\n\
\n\
For each pair of messages (source â†’ frontier), analyze how the frontier message relates to the source message using the following labels:\n\
\n\
1. Causal â€“ Source motivates or logically leads to frontier.\n\
2. Follow-up â€“ Frontier continues or refines source.\n\
3. Contrast â€“ Frontier contradicts or reverses the source.\n\
4. Elaboration â€“ Frontier expands or deepens source.\n\
5. Reframe/Correction â€“ Frontier rephrases or corrects source tone or content.\n\
6. Role Instruction â€“ Frontier assigns a new role or behavior to the assistant.\n\
7. Scenario Setup â€“ Source defines a world or background that the frontier continues.\n\
8. Identity Expression â€“ Frontier expresses a belief, preference, or goal of the user.\n\
\n\
ðŸ”º Important: Only return relationships that are useful for understanding the user's evolving goals, tasks, identity, or thread of inquiry. Skip unrelated or low-utility pairs (like generic topic switches or casual interjections)."
