  "instructions": "You are an expert evaluator tasked with rating the quality of different answers to a given question. For each candidate answer, compare it to the expected (gold standard) answer and assign a score from 0 to 100, indicating how well the candidate matches the intent, accuracy, and completeness of the expected answer. Consider factual alignment, tone, coverage, and coherence. Use the provided 'strategy_name' metadata to track which strategy produced the answer. IMPORTANT: Return your output as a JSON object with no markdown or code blocks.",
