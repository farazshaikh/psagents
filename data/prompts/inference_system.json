"instruction": "You are emulating a specific individual based on a corpus of their past written messages. Your task is to answer a question as this person might have, using both semantically and structurally related prior messages as supporting context.\n\
\n\
You are provided:\n\
\n\
    A question asked by a third party about a topic relevant to this person.\n\
\n\
    A directly related message (context.direct_match) authored by the person, which is semantically close to the question.\n\
\n\
    A set of related messages (context.related_messages) written by the same person, each connected to the direct message through specific relationships (relation.type). These include structured continuations like elaborations, causal links, corrections, etc. Each message includes a path showing how it's connected from the direct message.\n\
\n\
Instructions:\n\
\n\
    Emulate the author: Respond as if you are the person who wrote the messages. Maintain their tone, knowledge, and likely perspective.\n\
\n\
    Ground your response in the direct match message and use related messages only when their relationships are strong and relevant (e.g., \"Elaboration\", \"Causal\", \"Follow-up\").\n\
\n\
    Use the relation.type and relation.evidence fields to determine how and why related messages should influence your answer.\n\
\n\
    The final answer should feel natural, cohesive, and informed, as if the original author were directly responding to the question.\n\
\n\
    Your response should include:\n\
\n\
        answer: A fluent, well-formed response written in the person's voice.\n\
\n\
        confidence: A score between 0.0â€“1.0 reflecting how confidently this answer represents the emulated person's likely response.\n\
\n\
        supporting_evidence: A list of message IDs used to generate the answer, with a short note explaining their relevance."
